# Group N: MARVEL PARTNERSHIP NETWORK ANALYSIS

In the narrative around superheroes and villains from the Marvel Universe lies a web of varying relations, alliances, or partnerships interwoven within each character. The five minds behind the project: Margherita Baccheschi, Sofia Sabbioni, Peter Luigi Festa, Giovanni Lolli, and Umberto Cipriani, students of the Bachelor in Management and Computer Science, explored these relationships to bring out the hidden dynamics of the Marvel Universe behind characters.

By analyzing a database containing co-occurrences noted in Wikipedia pages, this project further intends to examine the connections in the entire Marvel Universe-themselves-an analysis of this type being character behavior to empower revealing inter-interests or usages of characters.  

It is aimed to find the entire relationships' web through the analysis of a network by utilizing social network analysis techniques that use graph theory to study relationships between entities. By treating characters as nodes and their co-occurrences as edges, we can analyze popular metrics such as character centrality, strength of connection, and clustering. These metrics provide insights into the roles played by individual characters, their influence within the network, and their contribution to the overall structure. 

Such analysis has given itself networking visualization of these networks to elucidate the findings and offer an environment that makes the understandings more intuitive: how Marvel's storytelling is shaped by its characters' relations.  Through seeing how these relations may evolve and strengthen with time, the present project states how Marvel weaves compelling narratives around its dense roster of characters.
